# create-react-app

If you are beginner and you don't know where to start with React.js. This tool can help you to overcome the project initialization. In order to do this you need only one line of code `npx create-react-app app-name`. Under the hood, they are using webpack, Babel, ESLint and other projects to help you to build the app. If you ever wanted an advanced configuration just use `npm run eject`, it will extract default configuration in your project directory.
