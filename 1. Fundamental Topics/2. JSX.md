# JSX

JSX is which is [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) /to make easy to write/ used for React. This syntax is intented to be used by preprocessors(i.e Babel) to transform into standard javascript code which browser can understand. In simple words, unlike the past we put HTML code into javascript file.

Let's say we have following JSX code:

```html
<div className="sidebar">...</div>
```

And Babel transforms into:

```javascript
React.createElement('div', { className: 'sidebar' });
```

Do you noticed that we used `className` instead of `class`. Because JSX has some restrictions `className` is one of them. [More](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
