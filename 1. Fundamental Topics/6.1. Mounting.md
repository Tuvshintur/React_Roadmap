# 1. Mounting

Mounting means we are putting component into DOM. React has 4 buil-in functions that called during mounting a component:

1. **constructor()**
   This method is called first, when the component initiated, and it is natural place to set up initial state and other initial values. Also the React component should inherited from `React.Component` which has props in the constructor we need to initiate parent's constructor method. In order to that, just add `super(props)` and do not forget to add `props` as argument.

    ```javascript
    class App extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {auth : false};
        }
        render() {
            const {auth} = this.state;
            return (
                <h1>{auth ? 'Authenticated' : 'Not authenticated'</h1>
            )
        }
    }
    ```

1. **static getDerivedStateFromProps()**
   This method is called right before rendering component in the DOM. This is the natural place to set the `state` object based on the initial `props`. It takes `state` as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the `state` or null to update nothing.

    ```javascript
    class App extends React.Component {
         constructor(props) {
             super(props);
             this.state = {auth : false};
         }

        static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
            return {auth : props.auth}
        }

         render() {
             const {auth} = this.state;
             return (
                 <h1>{auth ? 'Authenticated' : 'Not authenticated'</h1>
             )
         }
     }
    ```

    This method has [rare use cases.](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#when-to-use-derived-state)

1. **render()**
   This method is required for any component and it is the method that put components to DOM.

    ```javascript
    class App extends React.Component {
        render() {
            return <h1>App component</h1>;
        }
    }
    ```

1. **componentDidMount()**
   This method is called after the component is rendered. This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.

    ```javascript
    class App extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.state = {auth : false};
        }

        componentDidMount() {
            setTimeout(()=>{
                this.setState(auth:true);
            }, 1000);
        }

        render() {
            const {auth} = this.state;
            return (
                <h1>{auth ? 'Authenticated' : 'Not authenticated'</h1>
            )
        }
    }
    ```
