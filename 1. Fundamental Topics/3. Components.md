#Components

IRL, we understands the word component as the part of element of a whole thing. It's same for the React. We have two ways to define components `class` and `function`. To define class component, you need to extend `React.Component`.

```javascript
class Welcome extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
    }
}
```

The other way is just declare javascript function.

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
}
```

###Difference

1. Functional Component
    1. Basic Javascript function. Can be arrow and regular function.
    1. It's referred as `dumb` or `stateless` component as mainly responsible for rendering UI.
    1. React lifecycle methods(e.g componentDidMount) **cannot** be used in it. Even render method doesnt exist.
    1. In the first, it only used as getting props and rendering in format. But React 16.8 introduced React Hooks.
1. Class Component
    1. Using ES6 class and extend `React.Component` class in React.
    1. It's referred as `smar` or `stateful` component as they tend to implement logic and state.
    1. React lifecycle methods(e.g componentDidMount) **can** be used in it.
